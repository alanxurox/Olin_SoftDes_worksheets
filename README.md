# Software Design Course Repository, Spring 2021

Welcome to the course repository for SoftDes Spring 2021! This is where you can
find the assignments and worksheets for the course.

Over the semester, new files will be added to this repository, so you may find
that not everything is in place yet. There are two main folders in this repo:

* `assignments/`, which houses all of the assignments in this course.
* `worksheets/`, which houses all of the worksheets in this course.

Before you start working on these, you'll want to do a few things to get set up.
(We'll go over these instructions in class, but in case you want to get started
on your own, you can do so.)

First, *fork* this repository to your account by clicking the "Fork" button in
the upper-right corner of this page. This creates a copy of the repo in your
account.

Then, *clone* this repository to your machine like this:

1. Navigate to **your fork** of this repository (the URL should have your
   username in it).
2. Click on the green "Code" button near the top of the page. If you set up an
   SSH key in your computational setup, copy the SSH URL. Otherwise, copy the
   HTTPS URL.
3. In a Terminal on Ubuntu, run the command `git clone URL`, where `URL` is the
   one you copied earlier.
4. Go into the repository by running `cd softdes-2021-01`.
5. Follow the steps in [this
   guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork)
   to set up the original repository (the one with `olincollege` in the URL) as
   an upstream remote.

Again, we'll go through this process in class, so no worries if you get stuck.
Feel free to ask for help on Discord, in the #github channel.
